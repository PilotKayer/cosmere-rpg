### Release 0.2
We’re thrilled to share **v0.2**, which brings exciting new features, improvements, and bug fixes to the system.

#### Radiant Paths Are Here!  
Radiant paths have arrived, introducing surges and key features to support other Investiture systems. This update brings the iconic powers of the Knights Radiant to life while laying the groundwork for the wider Cosmere.

##### What’s New?  
- **Radiant Paths & Surges:** Radiant paths and surges are now available through the latest version of the playtest materials module.  
- **Powers:** A new, flexible item type for magical abilities, starting with surges and scalable for future Investiture systems.  
- **Path-Linked Skills:** Paths can now be configured to display linked skills alongside the path on the character sheet, offering clarity and flexibility.  
- **Automated Rewards:** Goals can now be set up to automatically grant specific rewards upon completion.

#### Talent Trees  
Talent trees mark the first step toward implementing advancement and leveling in the system. Developed alongside Radiant Paths, they provide a more accurate way to model how the Cosmere RPG handles talents. As a result, **Specialty items** are now deprecated and should no longer be used.
